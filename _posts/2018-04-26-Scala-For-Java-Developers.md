The purpose of this article is not to compare Java with Scala, even because each one uses different paradigms. So while the first is objected-oriented programming, the another one is funcional programming (but it also works objected-oriented). FIrst of all, what I am going to try to describe here it is my perspective as a Java developer learning Scala language.
Basically, I would really recommend to learn some paradigms and concepts about funcional programming such as pure functions, recursion and higher-order function before to start with Scala, but this is just a suggestion, you do not need to follow it. Actually, I say that because at some moment I have decided to follow this order: to learn the concepts and then to apply those concepts to the Scala language, so this way works to me.

## Why Scala?
Scala definitely has many advantages when compared to Java in terms of easiness to use concurrency, optimitization of code complexity and concise notation, among others. In Scala, we can do all the stuff that we do in Java and more something else, so it's like a Java++.

## Some Curiosities
* The semicolons are missing
* The public access modifier is missing
* The declaration of main start with def




## My Experience

## Let's try some codes

### Immutable - Immutability

Example code:

- var
- val

###  Defining function

```scala
val func = (x: String) => x.length

def func(x: String): Int = s.length

//OR using automatic type inference
def func(x: String) = s.length
```
### Type Inference
```scala
val foo = "word""
val listOfSomething = List(1,2,3)
```
