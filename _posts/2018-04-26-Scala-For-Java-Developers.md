## Why Scala?
Scala definitely has many advantages when compared to Java in terms of easiness to use concurrency, optimitization of code complexity and concise notation, among others. Actually, in Scala, we can do all the stuff that we do in Java, so it's like a Java++.

## Some Curiosities
* The semicolons are missing
* The public access modifier is missing
* The declaration of main start with def


# lazy val
- declares an immutable variable, with its value computed on demand and memoized



## My Experience

## Let's try some codes

### Immutable - Immutability

Example code:

- var
- val

###  Defining function

```scala
val func = (x: String) => x.length

def func(x: String): Int = s.length

//OR using automatic type inference
def func(x: String) = s.length
```
### Type Inference
```scala
val foo = "word""
val listOfSomething = List(1,2,3)
```
